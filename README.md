# Randomize

[https://randomize.co](https://randomize.co)

The **ultimate** person randomizer. 

This project does not put into practice [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), but it does have plenty of **FDD** (Fad Driven Development). Have you ever wondered how many technologies can be successfully squeezed into a single side project? We're about to find out.
